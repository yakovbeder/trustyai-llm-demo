This is the code-base for the February 2026 OpenShift AI Safety and Eval demo in Istanbul.

This demo walks through all of TrustyAI's current Llama Stack features:
1) [LM-Eval-Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)
2) [NVIDIA Garak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak/tree/main)
3) [NVIDIA-NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Guardrails)
4) [Ragas](https://github.com/vibrantlabsai/ragas)

We'll use all four of these tools in a financial services use-case, walking through initial capability
assessment, risk analysis, risk mitigation, and continuous RAG evaluations. Everything runs self-hosted in OpenShift AI. 

Specifically, we'll take a [Qwen/Qwen3-30B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507) model for inference and a [Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B) for embedding, and:
1) Evaluate `Qwen3-30B`'s accounting, microeconomics, and macroeconomics knowledge in both Turkish and English via the [Global-MMLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohereLabs/Global-MMLU) evaluation in lm-evaluation-harness
2) Run a custom evaluation in lm-evaluation-harness to evaluate `Qwen3-30B`'s aptitude for loan assessments via the [CRA-LendingClub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheFinAI/cra-lendingclub/viewer) dataset.
3) Use NVIDIA Garak to assess our model's susceptibility to prompt injection
4) Use NVIDIA-NeMo Guardrails to secure our model against prompt injection attempts
5) Re-run the Garak scan against our guardrails to verify the new security of the system
6) Use Ragas to perform continuous evaluation of the quality of our `Qwen3-30B` + `Qwen3-0.6B-embedding` RAG system, using the [FinDER](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linq-AI-Research/FinDER) financial question answering dataset.
 
## Viewing the Demo
1) To just see the visual material for the demo, you can view the [accompanying presentation.](https://rawcdn.githack.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-llm-demo/d693cf7c3e3cc548dd6357ab1383520bef1e8d41/fsi-llamastack-demo/notebooks/fsi_safety_demo_presentation.html) 
   
2) You can view the [pre-computed notebook here.](notebooks/fsi_safety_demo_notebook.ipynb)
3) If you'd like to replicate the demo in your own environment, follow the steps below.

## Pre-requisites
An OpenShift cluster with 2 GPU nodes:
1) 1 node needs at least 4 GPUs, I'd recommend a `g5.12xlarge` AWS node
2) 1 node needs a single GPU, e.g., a `g4dn.2xlarge` AWS node.

## Setup
1) Install RHOAI as described in [../docs/installing_rhoai.md](../docs/installing_rhoai.md). In the 
DataScienceCluster, make sure that:
    1) TrustyAI is set to `Removed`
   2) DataSciencePipelines is set to `Managed`
   3) The llama-stack-operator is set to `Managed`
2) This demo uses a combination of existing and preview TrustyAI 
features, so we'll install a custom deployment of the TrustyAI operator:
    ```shell
    oc apply -f deployment/trustyai_bundle.yaml -n redhat-ods-applications
    ```
3. Start our Kubeflow Pipeline server, create the required service accounts, and download the necessary model artifacts:
    ```shell
    oc new-project model-namespace || oc project model-namespace || true
    oc apply -f deployment/kfp.yaml -n model-namespace
    oc apply -f deployment/serviceaccount.yaml -n model-namespace
    oc apply -f deployment/model_storage_container.yaml -n model-namespace
    echo "Waiting for model and dataset downloads to finish..."
    oc wait --for=condition=Available deployment/model-s3-storage-emulator --timeout=600s
    ```
4. Deploy the models. We'll be using a [Qwen/Qwen3-30B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507) model for inference and a [Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B) for embedding:
    ```shell
    oc apply -f deployment/models/qwen3-30.yaml -n model-namespace
    sleep 5 # wait for Qwen3-30b model to schedule
    oc apply -f deployment/models/embedding_model.yaml -n model-namespace
    echo "Waiting for model deployment readiness..."
    oc wait --for=condition=Available deployment/qwen3-predictor --timeout=600s
    oc wait --for=condition=Available deployment/embedding-predictor --timeout=600s
    ```
5. Deploy Llama stack:
    ```shell
    oc create configmap llama-stack-config --from-file=deployment/llama_stack/run.yaml -n model-namespace
    oc apply -f deployment/llama_stack/lls_distro.yaml
    oc expose service llama-stack-distro-service --name=lls-route
    ```
